# ML-Classification-and-clustering
This repository goes deep into displaying:
          **Classification
          **Clustering
          
It does this by use of K-Means clustering, decision trees and logistic regression in the notebooks

Important Note: 
The notebooks are written in report format and therefore code is well explained along side the code.
